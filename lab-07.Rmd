### Packages and Data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

```

```{r read-data}
evals<-read.csv("data/evals.csv", row.names=1)
```

# Exercise 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

1.  Visualize the distribution of `score` in the dataframe `evals`.

```{r viz-score}
# add code here
```

*Add your other details and narratives here.*

2.  Visualize and describe the relationship between `score` and `bty_avg` using `geom_point()` to represent the data.

```{r scatterplot}
# add code here
```

*Add your narrative and other details here.*

# Exercise 2: Simple Linear regression with a numerical predictor

1.  Fit a linear model called `score_bty_fit` to predict average professor evaluation `score` from average beauty rating (`bty_avg`). Print the regression output using `tidy()`.

```{r fit-score_bty_fit, eval = FALSE}
# remove eval = FALSE from the code chunk options after filling in the blanks
score_bty_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(___ ~ ___, data = ___)
```

```{r tidy-score_bty_fit, eval = FALSE}
# remove eval = FALSE from the code chunk options after filling in the blanks
tidy(___)
```

*Add your linear model here. Don't worry too much about notation, you can use things like score-hat.*

2.  Plot the data again using `geom_jitter()`, and add the regression line.

```{r viz-score_bty_fit,eval=FALSE}
# add your plot here. Hint, you can add the regression line using geom_smooth()
```

3.  Interpret the slope of the linear model in context of the data.

*Add your interpretation here*

4.  Interpret the intercept of the linear model in context of the data. Comment on whether or not the intercept makes sense in this context.

*Add your interpretation here*

5.  Determine the $R^2$ of the model and interpret it in the context of the data.

```{r R2, eval = FALSE}
# remove eval = FALSE from the code chunk options after filling in the blanks
glance(___)$___
```

*Add your interpretation here*

6.  Make a plot of residuals vs. predicted values for the model above.

```{r viz-score_bty_fit-diagnostic, eval = FALSE}
# remove eval = FALSE from the code chunk options after filling in the blanks
score_bty_aug <- augment(score_bty_fit$fit)

ggplot(___) + ...
```

# Exercise 3: Simple Linear regression with a categorical predictor

0.  Look at the variable rank, and determine the frequency of each category level.

```{r}
# ... 
```

1.  Fit a new linear model called `score_rank_fit` to predict average professor evaluation `score` based on `rank` of the professor.

```{r fit-score_rank_fit}
# fit model

# tidy model output
```

*Add your narrative here.*

2.  Fit a new linear model called `score_gender_fit` to predict average professor evaluation `score` based on `gender` of the professor.

```{r fit-score_gender_fit}
# fit model

# tidy model output
```

```{r score_gender_intercept, eval=FALSE}
# remove eval = FALSE from the code chunk options
score_gender_intercept <- tidy(score_gender_fit) %>% 
  filter(term == "(Intercept)") %>%
  select(estimate) %>%
  pull()
```

```{r score_gender_slope, eval=FALSE}
# remove eval = FALSE from the code chunk options
score_gender_slope <- tidy(score_gender_fit) %>% 
  filter(term == "gendermale") %>%
  select(estimate) %>%
  pull()
```

*Add your narrative here. Use in-line code!*

# Exercise 4: Multiple linear regression

1.  Fit a multiple linear regression model, predicting average professor evaluation `score` based on average beauty rating (`bty_avg`) and `gender.`

```{r fit-score_bty_gender_fit}
# fit model

# tidy model output
```

*Add your narrative here.*

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(___) + ...
```

2.  What percent of the variability in `score` is explained by the model `score_bty_gender_fit`.

```{r}
# ...
```

3.  What is the equation of the line corresponding to just male professors?

*Add your equation here.*

4.  For two professors who received the same beauty rating, which gender tends to have the higher course evaluation score?

*Add your narrative here.*

5.  How does the relationship between beauty and evaluation score vary between male and female professors?

*Add your narrative here.*

6.  How do the adjusted $R^2$ values of `score_bty_fit` and `score_bty_gender_fit` compare?

```{r eval=FALSE}
# remove eval = FALSE from the code chunk options after filling in the blanks
glance(___)$adj.r.squared
glance(___)$adj.r.squared
```

*Add your narrative here.*

7.  Compare the slopes of `bty_avg` under the two models (`score_bty_fit` and `score_bty_gender_fit`).

*Add your narrative here.*
